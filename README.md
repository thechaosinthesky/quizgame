# Particle IO Quizgame

A simple one page math game, which integrates with the Particle API to pulse a Particle/Spark IO device pin when an answer is correct.

## Features:

* Parachuter theme
* Plays music and encouragement sound on correct answer
* Unique set of 10 questions created

## Parachuter Interactive Implementation:

A Particle/Spark IO device can be paired with a homemade reel, to raise a toy parachuter when the user answers a question correctly. Connect the particle board to a paper towel roll, to reel in a string when the output pin pulses high. The string should be threaded through a toilet paper roll. The toy parachuter is lightly fastened to the string. When the parachuter reaches the top, it is released by the toilet paper roll, and the parachuter floats down.
